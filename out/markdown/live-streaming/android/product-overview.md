# Interactive Live Streaming Premium Overview {#product-name-overview}

Interactive Live Streaming Premium enables one-to-many and many-to-many audio or video live streaming with the Agora Video SDK.

Interactive Live Streaming Premium is different from [Agora Video Call](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/product_video?platform=All%20Platforms). In a video call, all users are the same role and can talk to each other freely. In an Interactive Live Streaming Premium, users can be the host or audience, where only the host can talk. For details, see this [FAQ](https://docs.agora.io/en/faq/profile_difference).

Different from the traditional CDN live broadcast, which only allows one-way communication from the hosts to the audience, the Agora Video SDK empowers the audience to interact with the hosts by [becoming a host](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/terms?platform=All%20Platforms#becoming-host), like a viewer jumping onto the stage in the middle of a play to perform.

## Live streaming solution comparison {#live-streaming-solution-comparison}

The following table shows the differences between Agora live streaming products and traditional CDN live streaming:

||Agora Interactive Live Streaming Premium|Agora Interactive Live Streaming Standard|Traditional CDN live streaming|
|--|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
|Typical scenarios|Live streaming events where the host\(s\) and audience have frequent audio and video interactions that require ultra-low latency on the audiences' clients.|Live streaming events where the host\(s\) must be able to respond quickly to the audience's text messages, comments, and virtual rewards or that require less frequent audio and video interactions.|Live streaming events that do not require audio or video interactions.|
|Latency|-   Latency from one host to another host: < 400 ms
-   Latency on the audience's client: 400 ms - 800 ms

|Latency on the audience's client: 1500 ms - 2000 ms|Latency on the audience's client: \> 3000 ms|
|Synchronization|-   Excellent synchronization between the host\(s\) and the audience
-   Excellent synchronization among the audience

|-   Good synchronization between the host\(s\) and the audience
-   Good synchronization among the audience

|-   Poor synchronization between the host\(s\) and the audience
-   Poor synchronization among the audience

|
|Interactive experience|Excellent|Good|Poor|
|Pricing|High|Moderate|Low|

**Note:**

-   A host's client refers to the client that calls an API to set the user role as host. An audience's client refers to the client that calls an API to set the user role as audience. A host can both send and receive streams, while an audience member can only receive streams.
-   The latency between host's clients in Interactive Live Streaming Standard is the same as that in Interactive Live Streaming Premium, while the latency level on the audience's client in these two products is different:
    -   Interactive Live Streaming Standard: Low latency \(1500 ms - 2000 ms\) from the host's client to the audience's client.
    -   Interactive Live Streaming Premium: Ultra-low latency \(400 ms - 800 ms\) from the host's client to the audience's client.
-   You can switch seamlessly between Interactive Live Streaming Standard and Interactive Live Streaming Premium by calling `setClientRole` and setting the latency level as `low` on the audience's client.

**Note:**

-   **Lecture Hall**: In a large online class, the low latency of Interactive Live Streaming Standard allows the teacher's audio and video to be quickly synchronized to the clients of thousands of students. The low latency between the audio and video of the teacher and the courseware makes real-time teaching more effective. Students can interact with the teacher through text messages, online quizzes, and similar means to enhance the learning experience.
-   **Showroom**: In a showroom live streaming, the audience can send virtual gifts to the host. Thanks to the low latency of Interactive Live Streaming Standard, the host can promptly thank the audience for their gifts, and the audience can receive the host's thanks in a timely fashion, which helps to strengthen the emotional connection on both sides.
-   **Live-stream Shopping**: In a live-stream shopping scenario, customers can ask sellers for product and activity information via real-time messages. The low latency of Interactive Live Streaming Standard allows sellers to quickly respond to customers' questions, and customers can promptly see sellers' answers, thus encouraging transactions. In addition, the high synchronization of Interactive Live Streaming Standard ensures a consistent experience on the audiences' clients for activities such as responding to flash sales, and grabbing time-sensitive offers \(seckilling\) and coupons.
-   **Live match streaming**: Live streaming sporting events or games in real time, synchronized so that there are no problematic delays.
-   **Trivia Game**: Apart from providing a smooth live streaming experience, the high synchronization of Interactive Live Streaming Premium also ensures that players receive the questions at the same time. This gives the audience members the same amount of time to answerâ€”and an equal chance to win.
