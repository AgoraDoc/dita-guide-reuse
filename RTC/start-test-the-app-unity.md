# Test your app

To test your app, take the following steps:

1. In Unity, click **File** > **Build Settings**.
2. Select the platform that you want to build and run your app. This quickstart takes iOS as an example to build and run the app. You can go to **Player Settings** to set various options for your app built by Unity.
3. Click **Build** and Unity prompts you for a location to save the build. After Unity finishes building the iOS app, the Finder window appear containing the **Unity-iphone.xcodeproj** file.
4. Open the the **Unity-iphone.xcodeproj** file in Xcode, select your project, enable Automatic Signing, and select your team profile.
5. Click the ![play] button to run your project. When the app launches, you should be able to see [view].
5. Ask a friend to join the [feature] with you on the [demo app](https://webdemo.agora.io/basicVideoCall/index.html). Enter the same App ID and channel name.
