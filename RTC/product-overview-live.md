# [product-name] Overview

[product-name] enables one-to-many and many-to-many audio or video live streaming with the [sdk-name].

[product-name] is different from [Agora Video Call](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/product_video?platform=All%20Platforms). In a video call, all users are the same role and can talk to each other freely. In an [product-name], users can be the host or audience, where only the host can talk. For details, see this [FAQ](https://docs.agora.io/en/faq/profile_difference).

Different from the traditional CDN live broadcast, which only allows one-way communication from the hosts to the audience, the [sdk-name] empowers the audience to interact with the hosts by [becoming a host](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/terms?platform=All%20Platforms#becoming-host), like a viewer jumping onto the stage in the middle of a play to perform.
