# Test your app

Take the following steps to test your [platform] app:

1. In Terminal, go to the root folder of your project and run the following command:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   When the app launches, you should be able to see yourself on the local view.

2. Ask a friend to join the call with you on the [demo app](https://webdemo.agora.io/basicVideoCall/index.html). Enter the same App ID and channel name.
   <p props="video">After your friend joins the channel, you should be able to see and hear each other.</p>
   <p props="live">If your friend joins as a host, you should be able to see and hear each other; if as an audience member, you should only be able to see yourself while your friend can see and hear you.</p>
