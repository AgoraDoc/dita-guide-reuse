                    <li><b>Lecture Hall</b>: In a large online class, the low latency of Interactive Live Streaming Standard allows the teacher's audio and video to be quickly synchronized to the clients of thousands of students. The low latency between the audio and video of the teacher and the courseware makes real-time teaching more effective. Students can interact with the teacher through text messages, online quizzes, and similar means to enhance the learning experience.</li>
                    <li><b>Showroom</b>: In a showroom live streaming, the audience can send virtual gifts to the host. Thanks to the low latency of Interactive Live Streaming Standard, the host can promptly thank the audience for their gifts, and the audience can receive the host's thanks in a timely fashion, which helps to strengthen the emotional connection on both sides.</li>
                    <li><b>Live-stream Shopping</b>: In a live-stream shopping scenario, customers can ask sellers for product and activity information via real-time messages. The low latency of Interactive Live Streaming Standard allows sellers to quickly respond to customers' questions, and customers can promptly see sellers' answers, thus encouraging transactions. In addition, the high synchronization of Interactive Live Streaming Standard ensures a consistent experience on the audiences' clients for activities such as responding to flash sales, and grabbing time-sensitive offers (seckilling) and coupons.</li>
                    <li><b>Live match streaming</b>: Live streaming sporting events or games in real time, synchronized so that there are no problematic delays.</li>
                    <li><b>Trivia Game</b>: Apart from providing a smooth live streaming experience, the high synchronization of <ph keyref="product-name"/> also ensures that players receive the questions at the same time. This gives the audience members the same amount of time to answer—and an equal chance to win.</li>
