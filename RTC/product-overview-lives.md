# [product-name] Overview

[product-name] is a product designed for live streaming scenarios featuring “light interaction” between the host and audience. Light interaction in this case refers to situations that require a timely exchange of text messages, comments, or virtual gifts, with less reliance on audio or video communication. Typical scenarios include live online classes, live-stream shopping (e-commerce), trivia gaming, or live sports streaming.

The product adopts a UDP-based AUT protocol developed by Agora and relies on SD-RTN™, a software-defined real-time network built by Agora, to provide high-quality, low-latency live streaming experiences with good synchronization.
