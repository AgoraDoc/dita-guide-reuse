# Project setup

1. For new projects, create a directory named `agora_electron_quickstart`. For a basic Electron app, create the following files in the directory:

    - `package.json`: The configuration of your Electron project, such as project name and dependencies.
    - `index.html`: The visual interface with the user.
    - `main.js`: The main process of your Electron app.
    - `renderer.js`: The renderer process of your Electron app, where the APIs provided by the Agora SDK are implemented.

2. Integrate the [sdk-name] into your project.

   1. Modify the `package.json` file as follows:

      - `electron_version`ï¼šThe version number of Electron. You can set it to `12.0.0`, `11.0.0`, `10.2.0`, `9.0.0`, `7.1.2`, `6.1.7`, `5.0.8`, `4.2.8`, `3.0.6`, or `1.8.3`.
      - `prebuilt`: Set it as `true` to prevent compatibility issues.
      - `agora-electron-sdk`: The version number of the [sdk-name] for [platform]. See [Release notes](https://docs.agora.io/en/Voice/release_electron_video?platform=Electron) for details.
      - `electron`: Set it as the same as  `electron_version`.
